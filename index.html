     <h1>Hi viewers!</h1>
     <p>In hope to watch myself with pride, winning on every side of life, I take up every opportunity to improve myself and in the long run, give back to society by helping companies to meet their clients' needs, because hey,everyone deserves to be happy.
 They tell me to dream big and that everything is within reach. They never told me that halfway to my dream, the fiery passion
 dies down, doubts start to arise and you wonder if the dream is worth the struggle?
 My name is Louisa Amponsah Antwi. Anyone can dream, but i have <b>vowed</b> to make my dream a reality.

<h2>My Career So Far</h2>
<p>I am in my second year of tertiary institution, hoping to bag a degree in BSc.Chemical egnineering two years to come.
Courtesy of Ingressive4Good, I have been enrolled in Stutern's 1.4 cohort, hoping to have learnt all there is to become a successful back end developer. I am also taking a class in Data Analytics and a Python Coding to help me increase my employable skills and transfer these skills into my career.
Also, I would be attending an Ocupational Safety and Health Management Training in January to help me work with caution as an engineer. To crown it all, I have been called upon to be a delegate in the Geneva International Model United Nations, Ghana edition where I would be representing Turkey.This would help me improve my debating and negotiation skills. To achieve all these, I constantly remind myself of where I was and where I want to be and i do not look down on human relations in my quest to be indispensable to any person,agency or company I work with.
As you can see I have not achieved so much in life yet, but I am a work in progress.</p>
